# DualNetM-new
An Adaptive Attention-Driven Dual Network Framework for Inferring Functional Markers

DualNetM is a computational tool for Inferring Functional Markers from single-cell RNA-seq data.
It takes a prior gene interaction network,expression profiles and prior markers from scRNA-seq data as inputs, and consists of three main components, including gene 
regulatory network (GRN) construction, Functional Markers inference and Markers activity score
